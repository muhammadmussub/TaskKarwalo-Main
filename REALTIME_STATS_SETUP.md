# Fixing Real-time Stats in the Dashboard

This document provides instructions on how to fix the error "Could not find the function public.refresh_realtime_stats without parameters in the schema cache" and implement proper real-time stats in the admin dashboard.

## Step 1: Apply the Database Migration

Apply the migration file `20250910000000_fix_realtime_stats_function.sql` to your Supabase database using one of these methods:

### Option 1: Using the Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor
1. Log in to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Click "New Query"
4. Copy and paste the contents of the `20250910000000_fix_realtime_stats_function.sql` file
5. Click "Run" to execute the SQL

### Option 2: Using the Supabase CLI
```bash
supabase db push
```

### Option 3: Using Direct PostgreSQL Access
```bash
psql -h your-supabase-host -d postgres -U postgres -f 20250910000000_fix_realtime_stats_function.sql
```

## Step 2: Test the Functions

After applying the migration, you can test the functions:

1. In the Admin Dashboard, click the "Refresh Stats" button to fetch current statistics
2. Use the "Insert Test Stat" button to insert test data into the database
3. Use the "Get Count" button to verify that stats are being stored in the database

## Additional Information

The migration creates or replaces three key functions:

1. `refresh_realtime_stats()` - Refreshes all real-time statistics from actual database data
2. `insert_test_stat()` - Inserts test data for demonstration purposes
3. `get_stats_count()` - Returns the count of statistic records in the database

These functions allow the dashboard to display real, live data from your database instead of hardcoded values.

## Troubleshooting

If you continue to see the error after applying the migration:

1. Verify that the migration was applied successfully by checking for these functions in the Supabase dashboard
2. Clear your browser cache and reload the application
3. Check the browser console for any additional error messages
4. Ensure your Supabase client connection is properly configured

For persistent issues, you may need to manually run the `refresh_realtime_stats()` function directly in the SQL Editor to populate initial data.# Fixing Real-time Stats in the Dashboard
